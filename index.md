# new abstraction

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can think, learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. In the future, AI is expected to take on more tasks as technology advances and it is increasingly used to automate and optimize a wide range of processes. As a result, people will need to adapt and find new roles, such as that of an AI master, to manage and direct the integration and use of AI technologies within their field.

### AI as a new abstraction layer

Abstraction in computer science refers to the process of hiding away low-level implementation details and representing systems in terms of higher-level concepts, allowing for more efficient and manageable programming. AI technologies such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing provide a new layer of abstraction by processing and performing actions based on information provided. This helps human workers to focus on bigger concepts and changes their role by automating repetitive tasks and allowing them to focus on more complex and higher-level tasks.

In computing, the process of abstraction happens in several steps: 1. Physical components: electronic circuits manipulate signals for calculations and data storage. 2. Operating system: controls hardware resources and communicates with physical components. 3. Machine code: executed by the processor, interacts with the operating system. 4. High-level code: written in programming languages like Python or Java, compiled or interpreted into machine code. 5. User interface: allows user interaction with the program in a simple and intuitive way. Each layer provides more detail and a deeper understanding of how the computer works, while the first layer is the least abstract and requires the most knowledge of the underlying systems. Each layer after that hides the complexity of the layer below it, providing a higher level of abstraction and less detail.
